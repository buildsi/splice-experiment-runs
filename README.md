# Spliced Experiment Runs

Hoping we can do a subset of runs on here using the Docker experiment container!
See the [splice-experiment](https://github.com/buildsi/spliced-experiment) repository for details,
and the [.github/analysis.yaml](.github/analysis.yaml) for how the automation works,
and [here](https://github.com/buildsi/smeagle-examples) for the actions.
